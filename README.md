# Helps designing primers of given length and Tm value, for example for RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends) reactions which might require primers with unusually high Tm values for specificity purposes.

# Scans a nucleotide sequence and reports oligonucleotides of interest (with given length and Tm value).

# Uses BioPerl and oligotm of Primer3.
