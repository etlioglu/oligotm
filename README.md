# Helps designing primers of given length and Tm value, for example for RACE(Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends) reactions which might require primers with unusually high Tm values for the sake of sequence specificity.

# Scans a nucleotide sequence and reports oligonucleotides of interest.

# Uses BioPerl and oligotm of Primer3.
